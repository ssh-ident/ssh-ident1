= To Do for ssh-ident

== Likely changes
* [x] functionality for ssh-add to load all keys. Idea: `-I <identity>`. Uppercase `i` instead of lowercase to force loading keys.
* [ ] ssh-askpass issue, empty environmnt, `env -i` https://github.com/ccontavalli/ssh-ident/pull/34 or https://github.com/ccontavalli/ssh-ident/issues/18
* [x] support https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html[XDG_CONFIG_HOME], https://github.com/ccontavalli/ssh-ident/issues/40 +
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME defines the base directory relative to which user-specific configuration files should be stored. If $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is either not set or empty, a default equal to $HOME/.config should be used.
* [ ] check `scp user:hostname` issue (colon?), https://github.com/ccontavalli/ssh-ident/issues/35

== Unlikely changes
* [ ] Windows support, issues came with https://github.com/ccontavalli/ssh-ident/commit/e6145bdf0a51c18157f097d01823a9e3017428d4
